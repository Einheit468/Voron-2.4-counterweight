Currently only the upper suspension is functional.<br>
The main function is there, but the counterweight is not pulled directly when falling.<br>
The underside of the gantry is still missing.<br>

A counterweight to relieve the load on the gantry at the back of a Voron 2.4 350.<br>
It is intended to ensure that the load at deceleration in Z is less.<br>
It also counteracts sagging.<br>
However, it increases the acceleration torque.<br>

For this mod it is necessary that the Z drag chain hangs in the shadow of the gantry.<br>
It is also necessary to replace the wide cable drag with the cable drag that is normally installed in X / Y.<br>

Currently the project is only suitable for Voron 2.4 350s.<br>
