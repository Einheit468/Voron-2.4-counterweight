Danger! Alpha status!
Currently only the upper suspension is functional.
The main function is there, but the counterweight is not pulled directly when falling.
The underside of the gantry is still missing.
There are still missing:
- BOM list
- Print Part List
- Pictures
- Building instructions

A counterweight to relieve the load on the gantry at the back.
It is intended to ensure that the load at deceleration in Z is less.
It also counteracts sagging.
However, it increases the acceleration torque.
