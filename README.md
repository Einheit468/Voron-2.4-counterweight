The project is currently intended exclusively for Voron 2.4 350mm. <br>
The counterweight relieves the load on the rear Z stepper motors.<br>
Possible sagging of the gantry is also reduced.<br>

The disadvantage is that the acceleration force and braking force are increased.<br>

> **The project is not yet fully completed.** <br>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Z cable tie must/should be exchanged for one of the narrower X or Y cable ties.
