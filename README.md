The project is currently intended exclusively for __Voron 2.4 350mm__. <br>
The counterweight relieves the load on the rear Z stepper motors.<br>
Possible sagging of the gantry is also reduced.<br>

The disadvantage is that the acceleration force and braking force are increased.<br>

> [!WARNING]
> __The project is not yet fully completed.__ <br>
> - the building instructions are not finished yet. <br>
> - some pictures are still old versions. <br>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The __Z-cable chain__ must/should be exchanged for one of the narrower __X or Y cable chain__.
