# 01 modification AB-Gantry:<br>
* For better assembly, move or push the gantry approximately 2/3 upwards.<br>
* Completely remove the existing Z drag.<br>
* Insert 2x M3 Heat Set Inserts for the cable drag attachment into the "beldholder_flexible_button_cable_drag".<br>

(The image is without AB_Drive_Units, it starts where the profile ends.)
<br>
* Attach the button parts with stops to the original "AB_Drive_Units".<br>
* To do this, place M3 and M5 T-slots in the aluminum profile.<br>
* And fasten with the M3 screws provided.<br>
* Then attach the timing belts to the holders with the M5x16 screws.<br>
* Fill the cables with the narrower cable tow that you have from the X or Y tow, for example, as the Z tow. (Reason: The original Z-cable tow is wider than the aluminum profile)<br>

* Attach the cable tow to the top with the bracket.<br>
* Please note that the cable for the left motor branches off into the aluminum profile before it is attached.<br>

* Attention, the motor cable of the left motor is tight.<br>
