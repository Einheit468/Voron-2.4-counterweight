* Attach the button parts with stops to the original "AB_Drive_Units".<br>
* To do this, place M3 and M5 T-slots in the aluminum profile.<br>
* And fasten with the M3 screws provided.<br>
* cut the down belts to >55mm leng (leng not final tested!).
* cut the up belts to 47mm leng.
* Then attach the timing belts to the holders with the M5x16 screws.<br>
* Fill the cables with the narrower cable tow that you have from the X or Y tow, for example, as the Z tow. (Reason: The original Z-cable tow is wider than the aluminum profile)<br>

* Attach the cable tow to the top with the bracket.<br>
* Please note that the cable for the left motor branches off into the aluminum profile before it is attached.<br>

* Attention, the motor cable of the left motor is tight.<br>

<p/> <br>
  
* Pierce the holes in the support with the M8 screws.<br>
* Insert 6x M10 nuts into each screw and then tighten with the M8 nut. (But be careful, it's just plastic.)<br>
* Put as much weight as you think of. (I currently have 8 screws in it.)
* insert the 2 longitudinal bearings into the recess.<br>
* also put the 2 fits behind it.<br>
