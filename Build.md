> [!WARNING]
> The instructions refer to converting a built Voron, with a Can-Bus Toolhead.<br>
> Because the Z-cable chain needs to be replaced with the thinner ones.<br>
> Don't be surprised, the pictures are still old, the STL files are newer and correct.<br>


# 01 Printing
Printing the Parts with the normal settings of the Voron build.
- Material: ABS
- Layer heigh: 0.2mm
- Extrusion width: 0.4
- Infill: Grid, Gyroid, Honeycomb, Triangle or Cubic
- Infill Percentage: Recommended: 40%
- Wall Count: Recommended: 4
- Solide Top/Bottom Layer: Recommended: 5


# 02 modification AB-Gantry
&uarr; [back to top](#top)<br>

* For better assembly, move or push the gantry approximately 2/3 upwards.<br>
* Completely remove the existing Z chain.<br>
* Insert 2x M3 Heat Set Inserts for the cable chain attachment into the "beldholder_flexible_button_cable_drag".<br>

</p> <br>

* Attach the button parts with stops to the original "AB_Drive_Units".<br>
* To do this, place M3 and M5 T-slots in the aluminum profile.<br>
* And fasten with the M3 screws provided.<br>
* cut the down belts to 506mm leng.
* cut the up belts to 470mm leng.
* Then attach the timing belts to the holders with the M5x16 screws.<br>
* Fill the cables with the narrower cable tow that you have from the X or Y tow, for example, as the Z tow. (Reason: The original Z-cable tow is wider than the aluminum profile)<br>

* Attach the cable tow to the top with the bracket.<br>
* Please note that the cable for the left motor branches off into the aluminum profile before it is attached.<br>

* Attention, the motor cable of the left motor is tight.<br>

* Insert M3 Heat Set Inserts<br>
* Please do the same on the left side as on the right side.<br>
<br>

* Place the "T-Nut_Tool" on the aluminum profile and insert the T-Nut. <br> The side of the label is the side where the thread is located.<br>
* remove the "T-Nut_Tool"<br>
* bring the printparts to the aluminum profile<br>
<br>
<img src='images/beldholder_down_5.png' width='500'> <br>

* insert the screws into the holes provided on the T-nut. But only tighten the screws loosely.<br>
<br>
<img src='images/beldholder_down_6.png' width='500'> <br>
  
* Lay the cables for the tow as shown. <br> 
* And do not tighten the cable ties completely. <br> The cable should still be able to move back and forth. <br> The cable ties are initially used to ensure that no cables are crushed. <br>
* Cut off the ends of the cable ties. <br> 
<br>
<img src='images/beldholder_down_7.png' width='500'> <br>

* Set up the "cable_towing_support"<br>
* align all parts and tighten the screws for the "cable_towing_support" first<br>
* then attach all screws through the holes to the T-slot nuts<br>
* Attach the cable trailing end to the support.

# 04 counterweight

<p/> <br>
  
* Pierce the holes in the support with the M8 screws.<br>
* Insert 6x M10 nuts into each screw and then tighten with the M8 nut. (But be careful, it's just plastic.)<br>
* Put as much weight as you think of. (I currently have 8 screws in it.) <br>
* insert the 2 longitudinal bearings into the recess.<br>
* also put the 2 fits behind it.<br>

Don't forget to attach the M3 Heat Set Inserts to the bottom for the lid.
